Introduction
As we are in the era of digitalization and we as an individual also happens to be a using the same in our daily life. The year 2020 as we all witnessed was all about lockdown, quarantine, self-isolation, social distance. Despite all these, our country got a boost in Digital Payments/Transactions. India recorded 25.5 billion transactions surpassing China at 15.7 billion only.

Idea
NoIntPay standing out for No Internet Payment. As all of us aware of the fact that digital payments are going to be the future in the next few years and are soon gonna replace paper currency. This is possible because of the technology which is evolving out at a speedy rate making out new options for the firms/banks to choose from and making out more oriented banking systems.

There are not all the citizens in India have the golden luck of using "Basic Smart Phone" due to which this underserved section of the society is not able to get the benefits of using the same. Adding to it the internet facilities have not been able to reach out to all the parts of the country. Statically 50% of the population do not have access to the internet at all.

So to reach out the spread of digital transactions among all its citizens despite not having the opportunities for the larger section, we tend to incorporate a Non-Internet Payment system which allows everyone irrespective of whether the resident has no access to the internet or not having a basic smartphone.

SCQ Analysis:
S (Situation)
In case of network failure one can perform transactions directly through the bank without any third party involvement.
Be a boon for every citizen of the country.
C (Challenge)
Creating a separate module/library under the RBI for executing out these tasks
Getting out special provisions from Bank for regulating out all these
Need to learn out how does this works at first.
Q (Question)
Any Digital Transactions can be successfully terminated without the use of the Internet?
How this can be beneficial to the undeserved section?
